# Info
This is work in progress, the roadmap will basically be this: Bronze Age -> Iron Age -> Classical Age -> Late Antiquity -> Medieval -> Early Modern -> Modern -> Contemporary

This is open for suggestions, such as improving or reassesing a civ's uniques (basically a nerf or buff). Suggestions for new civs for already covered eras are open.
